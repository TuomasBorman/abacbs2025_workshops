<p>The ABACBS25 Conference have joined with BiocAsia to organise two full days of workshops immediately following the main conference. All workshops will be held in <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/gwrbmTE6J4puUPum9">Festival Tower</a> overlooking the Festival Theatre and the River Torrens.</p>
<p>All are welcome, including those who have attended the ABACBS Conference and those who simply wish to attend some high-quality training workshops. Registrations can be made via the main <a href="https://www.abacbs.org/abacbs-2025-workshops">ABACBS conference/workshop website</a> or via the <a href="https://biocasia2025.bioconductor.org/schedule/">BiocAsia website</a></p>
<p>Catering will be provided on both days in a common area</p>
<ul>
<li>10:30-11:00am Morning Tea</li>
<li>12:30-1:30pm Lunch</li>
<li>3:00-3:30pm Afternoon Tea</li>
</ul>
<p>Please find an outline of the currently scheduled sessions immediately below, along with a <a href="#full-table-with-abstracts">browsable table</a> including all abstracts</p>

A key challenge with \n      these approaches is accessibility, and much work is currently being \n      conducted to develop computational workflows to improve this access. \n      However, building, executing, and sharing workflows is challenging. The \n      difficulty only increases when implementing novel approaches like deep \n      learning, and even more so when moving these workflows to national\n      infrastructure to operate at scale. Some of the challenges include knowing \n      how to develop a workflow to optimise use of these large compute systems, \n      how to configure and deploy workflows that can efficiently employ both CPU \n      and GPU, and how to share the workflows created so that others can find,\n      understand, reuse, and ultimately cite the workflow. This workshop will \n      examine these challenges from the perspective of a workflow’s life cycle, \n      and in doing so provide both theory and hands-on activities that will \n      support bioinformaticians to develop, execute, and share computational \n      workflows for structural biology at scale.\n      "]}]},{"name":"div","attribs":{"className":"workshop-stream"},"children":[{"name":"h3","attribs":{},"children":["Workshop Stream(s)"]},{"name":"ul","attribs":{},"children":[{"name":"li","attribs":{},"children":["Scalable Workflows & Compute Infrastructure"]}]}]}]},{"name":"div","attribs":{"className":"workshop-detail"},"children":[{"name":"div","attribs":{"className":"workshop-title"},"children":[{"name":"h2","attribs":{},"children":["Orchestrating Microbiome Analysis with Bioconductor"]}]},{"name":"div","attribs":{"className":"workshop-presenter"},"children":[{"name":"h3","attribs":{},"children":["Presenter(s)"]},{"name":"Fragment","attribs":[],"children":["","Tuomas Borman",{"name":"sup","attribs":{},"children":["1"]}]},{"name":"Fragment","attribs":[],"children":[", ","Leo Lahti",{"name":"sup","attribs":{},"children":["1"]}]}]},{"name":"div","attribs":{"className":"workshop-institution"},"children":[{"name":"h3","attribs":{},"children":["Presenter Organisation(s)"]},{"name":"ol","attribs":{},"children":[{"name":"li","attribs":{},"children":["University of Turku, Finland"]}]}]},{"name":"div","attribs":{"className":"workshop-schedule"},"children":[{"name":"h3","attribs":{},"children":["Workshop Schedule"]},"Thursday 27 November 2025, 09:00AM"," to ","12:30PM",{"name":"p","attribs":{},"children":["This will be a 3 hour workshop with a 30 minute break"]}]},{"name":"div","attribs":{"className":"workshop-abstract"},"children":[{"name":"h3","attribs":{},"children":["Workshop Outline"]},{"name":"body","attribs":{},"children":[{"name":"p","attribs":{},"children":["\n        Because of the complex nature of microbiome data, robust and reproducible\n        computational approaches are essential.
